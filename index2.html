                <h2>Stephanie Czajkowski</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Stephanie Czajkowski, a junior developer, and a proud member of the
                    dynamic team behind this fun game. A retired Navy veteran, I
                    traded in my uniform for a keyboard to embark on a thrilling journey into the world
                    of software development. Hailing from the heart of South Louisiana, I'm passionate
                    about transforming ideas into functional tools using my skills in HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, Java, and more.
                    Beyond coding, you'll find me exploring virtual realms through video games, getting
                    lost in captivating sci-fi/fantasy novels, and indulging in various anime adventures.
                    Currently, my creative energy is invested in a special project - collaborating with my
                    talented graphic designer boyfriend to bring a video game to life.
                    Keep an eye out for my upcoming projects as I continue to challenge myself through
                    continuous education and self-study. Let's code the future together!</p>
