                <h2>Stephanie Czajkowski</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Stephanie Czajkowski, a junior developer, and a proud member of the
                    dynamic team behind this exciting learning platform. A retired Navy veteran, I
                    traded in my uniform for a keyboard to embark on a thrilling journey into the world
                    of software development. Hailing from the heart of South Louisiana, I'm passionate
                    about transforming ideas into functional tools using my skills in HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, Java, and more.
                    Beyond coding, you'll find me exploring virtual realms through video games, getting
                    lost in captivating sci-fi/fantasy novels, and indulging in various anime adventures.
                    Currently, my creative energy is invested in a special project - collaborating with my
                    talented graphic designer boyfriend to bring a video game to life.
                    Keep an eye out for my upcoming projects as I continue to challenge myself through
                    continuous education and self-study. Let's code the future together</p>

                <p>I'm a versatile professional who transitioned from the world of accounting to the 
                    dynamic realm of programming. Armed with expertise in HTML, CSS, Java, and 
                    JavaScript, I navigate the digital landscape with precision and creativity. Beyond the 
                    screen, I find joy in the simple pleasures of lifeâ€”cherishing moments with my family
                    and friends. When coding takes a pause, I indulge in the immersive realms of video 
                    games, finding both relaxation and inspiration in the virtual adventures they offer. 
                    Through the lens of both numbers and code, I'm on a journey of continual growth
